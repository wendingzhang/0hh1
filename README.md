# 0hh1


A lovely little logic game by Q42. Written in python by zwd

The source repo, please follow: github.com/Q42/0hh1

I don't understand the web code,such as HTML or Javascript, so I don't know
how to initialize the game.

But if you want to change the chanllenge of the game, please change the "NUMBER" 
in code.--4,6,8,10 are all avaliable.

Too busy to improve the game...
